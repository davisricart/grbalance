- Added dependency tracking to useEffect for consistent state updates

**Technical Details:**
- **File Modified:** `src/components/admin/UserManagement/ReadyForTestingTab.tsx`

## Environment Notes
- **Platform:** Windows PowerShell + WSL2
- **Deployment:** Netlify (local npm issues)
- **Database:** Supabase (Firebase completely removed)
- **Git Strategy:** Tag-based restore points for safety

---

## Next Steps
1. **Test pending user workflow** - Create test@test.com user

3. **Test bulk operations** - Multi-user approve/reject
4. **Verify test script functionality** - Critical business feature

## Critical Reminders for Future Development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER modify AdminPage structure** - Only database operations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Preserve test script functionality** - Top priority feature
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use Netlify for builds** - Local environment has issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **All operations are Supabase** - Zero Firebase allowed
