## üéØ SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR CURSOR

### **1. Documentation Completeness**
- Is there anything missing that Claude Web might need?
- Are the examples clear and comprehensive enough?
- Is the multi-modal approach (visual + technical + examples) sufficient?

### **2. Error Prevention**
- Does `DONT_DO_THIS.md` cover the most critical mistakes?
- Are there other common AI pitfalls we should document?
- Is the API documentation clear enough to prevent misuse?

### **3. Real Examples Integration**
- Is referencing actual production files (sample-data/) better than mock examples?
- Should we include more working script examples?
- Is the connection between docs and real files clear?

### **4. Upload Strategy**
- Should both folders (`Claude WEB Script Instructions/` + `sample-data/`) be uploaded?
- Is the folder structure optimal for Claude Web consumption?
- Are there any file organization improvements needed?

### **5. Success Metrics**
- What should we monitor after Claude Web deployment?
- How will we measure "zero-iteration script development"?
- What feedback loops should we establish?

## üìä EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### **Immediate Results** (Post-Upload)
- Claude Web builds scripts that work first time
- Professional table formatting automatically applied
- Zero differences between admin testing and client portal
- Reduced development time from hours to minutes

### **Quality Metrics**
