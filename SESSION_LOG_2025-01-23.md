## BookingPage Email Integration Fix

### Issue Identified
- User reported that emails from `/book` page "prefer to write to us" section were not being delivered
- BookingPage was using mock email submission with `setTimeout(resolve, 1000)` instead of actual email service
- ContactPage had working EmailJS integration but BookingPage did not

### Investigation
- Compared BookingPage.tsx and ContactPage.tsx implementations
- Found BookingPage had placeholder email functionality
- ContactPage had proper EmailJS configuration with:
  - Service ID: `service_grbalance`
  - Template ID: `template_rm62n5a`
  - User ID: `e-n1Rxb8CRaf_RfPm`

### Solution Implemented
1. **Added EmailJS Integration**:
   - Added `import emailjs from '@emailjs/browser'`
   - Added `useEffect` hook to initialize EmailJS
   - Replaced mock submission with real EmailJS service call

2. **Email Validation**:
   - Added regex validation: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]{2,}$/`
   - Updated error message to match ContactPage format
   - Prevents invalid emails like "asdfsd@asdfsd"

3. **Template Parameters**:
   - Configured to use same service and template as ContactPage
   - Subject set to "General Inquiry" to match ContactPage dropdown option

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/BookingPage.tsx`: Added EmailJS functionality and validation

### Testing
- Both pages now use identical EmailJS configuration
- Emails from both forms should deliver to same destination
- Validation prevents invalid email formats

### Deployment
- Changes committed with message: "fix: Enable EmailJS functionality for BookingPage contact form"
- Pushed to main branch
- Will auto-deploy via Netlify

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `TECHNICAL_CHANGELOG.md` with fix details
- Updated `CODEBASE_INDEX.md` to reflect BookingPage email functionality

### Result
✅ BookingPage contact form now properly sends emails via EmailJS
✅ Email validation matches ContactPage requirements
✅ Both forms deliver to same destination
✅ Changes deployed to production
