Once we've built your custom reconciliation script, you simply upload your reports and run your personalized comparison."},{question:"How does the setup process work?",answer:"We start with a consultation to understand your salon software, payment processors, and reconciliation needs. Then we build custom matching logic specifically for your data formats. Once your script is ready, you can upload files and get results instantly."},{question:"What file formats are supported?",answer:"We support Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV files (.csv). Files should have clear column headers and consistent data formats."},{question:"How are my monthly comparisons counted?",answer:"Each successful comparison counts toward your monthly limit. Failed comparisons or errors don't count. Your limit resets on the first day of each month."},{question:"How can I upgrade my plan?",answer:"Contact our support team to discuss adding more custom scripts or increasing your monthly comparison limits."},{question:"What if my data format changes?",answer:"No problem! If your salon software or payment processor changes their report format, we'll update your custom script at no additional charge. Your reconciliation will continue working seamlessly."},{question:"Is my data secure?",answer:"Your uploaded files are processed securely and never stored permanently.
