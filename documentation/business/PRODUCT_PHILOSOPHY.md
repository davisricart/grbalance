## Key Product Principles

### üéØ **Solve the Real Problem**
**Bridge the gap between rigid pre-built solutions and custom development.**

Most business software falls into two camps:
- **Rigid tools**: Fast to deploy but limited flexibility 
- **Custom development**: Maximum flexibility but high cost/complexity

**Our approach**: **Guided flexibility** - users can build custom reconciliation logic without writing code from scratch.

### ü§ñ **AI as Assistant, Not Replacement**
- AI guides and assists the development process
- Users maintain control and understanding of their logic
- Sustainable approach that empowers rather than obscures

### ‚ö° **Immediate Feedback Loops**
- Real-time testing environment with sample data
- Step-by-step validation reduces iteration cycles
- Users can immediately see results and adjust

### üõ†Ô∏è **Lower Technical Barriers, Maintain Power**
- Complex reconciliation logic made accessible
- No sacrifice of functionality for ease of use
- Progressive disclosure - simple for basic use, powerful for advanced needs

### üèóÔ∏è **Sound Technical Architecture**
- Dynamic code generation for flexibility and performance
- Clean separation of concerns
- Extensible foundation for future growth and pivots
