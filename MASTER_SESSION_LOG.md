## 🚨🚨 CRITICAL: NEW SESSION RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS 🚨🚨

### 🤖 **FOR AI ASSISTANT**: 
**If this is a new session, READ THIS ENTIRE FILE FIRST before responding to any user requests.**

**🔧 MANDATORY STARTUP SEQUENCE:**
1. **Read complete session log** for context recovery
2. **Check current system health** - Look for Node.js process buildup
3. **Suggest system cleanup if needed** - Proactively prevent freezing
4. **Resume work from exact stopping point** - Continue pending tasks

**📋 System Health Check Script (run automatically at session start):**
```powershell
# Quick system health assessment
tasklist | findstr node.exe | measure-object | select-object Count
netstat -an | findstr ":51" | measure-object | select-object Count
```

**🚨 Health Check Thresholds:**
- **If >10 Node processes**: Recommend immediate cleanup with `.\system-cleanup.ps1`
- **If >3 dev server ports**: Recommend killing all Node processes first
- **If system feels sluggish**: Proactively suggest maintenance

### 👤 **FOR USER**: 
**When starting a new session, just say: "Read session log" or "Check the session log"**
*(Any variation mentioning the session log will work perfectly)*

**🎯 Expected AI Response Pattern:**
1. ✅ Context recovered from session log
2. 🔧 System health checked automatically  
3. 💡 Cleanup suggested if needed (before starting work)
4. 🚀 Ready to continue exactly where we left off

## 🛠️ SYSTEM MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE - PREVENT FREEZING & AI DISCONNECTIONS

### 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Multiple Node.js processes cause system overload
- **Problem**: 30+ Node processes = 1.4GB+ memory usage = System freezing = AI disconnections
- **Solution**: Routine cleanup prevents resource exhaustion
- **Tool Created**: `system-cleanup.ps1` for automated maintenance

### ⏰ **RECOMMENDED TIMING**:

#### **🌅 Daily Startup** (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **When**: Every morning before starting work
- **Command**: `.\system-cleanup.ps1`
- **Why**: Clears overnight zombie processes
- **Time**: Takes 10 seconds, saves hours of frustration

#### **🔄 Long Session Breaks** (2-3 hours)
- **When**: During lunch break or when stepping away
- **Quick Check**: `tasklist | findstr node.exe | measure-object | select-object Count`
- **If >5 processes**: Run cleanup script
- **Why**: Prevents gradual performance degradation

#### **🚨 Emergency Cleanup** (As Needed)
- **Triggers**: 
  - Cursor becomes unresponsive
  - AI keeps disconnecting
  - System feels sluggish
  - "Window not responding" dialogs
- **Immediate Action**: `taskkill /F /IM node.exe` then `npm run dev`

### 📋 **MAINTENANCE COMMANDS**:
```powershell
# Quick health check (run anytime)
tasklist | findstr node.exe | measure-object | select-object Count

# Full cleanup (daily recommended)
.\system-cleanup.ps1

# Emergency cleanup (when system frozen)
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
npm run dev
```

### 🎯 **SESSION NOTES INTEGRATION**:
- **Before every new AI session**: Check if >10 Node processes running
- **Add to recovery checklist**: System maintenance status
- **Track in logs**: When last cleanup was performed
- **Success metric**: Zero system freezes during work sessions

  const isSelected = element.classList.contains('selected');
  const color = fileNumber === 1 ? 'green' : 'blue';
  
  if (isSelected) {
    // Revert to outlined style
    element.classList.remove('selected', `bg-${color}-600`, 'text-white');
    element.classList.add(`border-${color}-600`, `text-${color}-600`);
  } else {
    // Change to solid style
    element.classList.add('selected', `bg-${color}-600`, 'text-white');
    element.classList.remove(`border-${color}-600`, `text-${color}-600`);
  }
};

// Enhanced badge HTML with click handlers
<span class="inline-block px-2 py-1 border cursor-pointer transition-colors ${fileNumber === 1 ? 'border-green-600 text-green-600 hover:bg-green-600 hover:text-white' : 'border-blue-600 text-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-600 hover:text-white'} text-xs rounded font-mono" onclick="toggleBadgeStyle(this, ${fileNumber})">
```
